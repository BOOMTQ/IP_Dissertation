	abstract = {The invention relates to an information search method based on a heuristic method. The information search method includes the steps of determining parameter types corresponding to information importance according to features of information, wherein each parameter type comprises at least one keyword, keywords in parameters of the same type are divided into different levels and different weights are set; storing the parameter types, the keywords and the weights of the keywords in a hash mode, and building an index; obtaining a keyword vector of each piece of undetermined information, finding the keywords and the weights in the index, aggregating the weights of the keywords in parameters of different types, obtaining the weight of the information, and subtracting the upper limit of the weights from the weight of the information to obtain heuristic information; obtaining the overall assessment of each piece of the undetermined information according to the heuristic information by means of a heuristic algorithm, determining the most valuable information and outputting a search result. The heuristic search method guarantees time-validity of the information, can save computation time and space, and improves information search efficiency and accuracy.},

	abstract = {Secure semantic searching provides privacy-preserving information retrieval for arbitrary queries semantically related to keywords. However, current verification mechanisms cannot verify the correctness of search results for semantically related queries in mutual distrust scenarios. Moreover, most secure semantic searching schemes still perform exact matching on ciphertext after query expansion, then directly accumulate the weights of the matched keywords as similarity measurements to rank the documents, resulting in the search results with unsatisfied ranking. In this paper, we propose a secure heuristic semantic searching scheme, in which a privacy-preserving word nonlinear matching (PPWNM) method is developed, and a blockchain-based verification is designed to obtain trustworthy search results with high retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we describe several retrieval heuristics and formulate them as a word nonlinear matching problem, then transform it to the PPWNM problem for calculating the similarity measurement between the query and document so that the highly accurate ranked results can be obtained. Also we design a blockchain-based verification mechanism in which the blockchain nodes utilize the proofs generated during the matching process to verify the correctness of the search results and reach a consensus to ensure the trustworthy results and fair payment between the participants in a mutual distrust model. Our security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is secure and has higher accuracy compared with the existing other schemes.},

In this study, we compare three different well-known extraction libraries including BeautifulSoup, lxml and regex. The experimental results indicate that regex achieves the best results with an average of 0.071 ms. However, it is difficult to generate correct extraction rules for regex when the number of inner elements is not known. In experiments, only \%43.5 of the extraction rules are suitable for this task. In this case, BeautifulSoup and lxml, which are the DOM-based libraries, are used for extraction process. In experiments, lxml library yields the best results with an average of 9.074 ms.},

Because traditional problem-solving methods are no longer capable of handling this level of complexity, heuristic search methods have attracted increasing attention in recent years for solving such problems. Inspired by nature, biology, statistical mechanics, physics and neuroscience, heuristics techniques are used to solve many problems where traditional methods have failed.

	abstract = {Web scraping or web crawling refers to the procedure of automatic extraction of data from websites using software. It is a process that is particularly important in fields such as Business Intelligence in the modern age. Web scrapping is a technology that allow us to extract structured data from text such as HTML. Web scrapping is extremely useful in situations where data isn’t provided in machine readable format such as JSON or XML. The use of web scrapping to gather data allows us to gather prices in near real time from retail store sites and provide further details, web scrapping can also be used to gather intelligence of illicit businesses such as drug marketplaces in the darknet to provide law enforcement and researchers valuable data such as drug prices and varieties that would be unavailable with conventional methods. It has been found that using a web scraping program would yield data that is far more thorough, accurate, and consistent than manual entry. Based on the result it has been concluded that Web scraping is a highly useful tool in the information age, and an essential one in the modern fields. Multiple technologies are required to implement web scrapping properly such as spidering and pattern matching which are discussed. This paper is looking into what web scraping is, how it works, web scraping stages, technologies, how it relates to Business Intelligence, artificial intelligence, data science, big data, cyber securityو how it can be done with the Python language, some of the main benefits of web scraping, and what the future of web scraping may look like, and a special degree of emphasis is placed on highlighting the ethical and legal issues.},

This article uses unique access to a volunteer group’s database focused on preventing pet scams to explore this type of crime. Distances, among other factors, make the purchase of pets online common in countries such as the USA, Australia and South Africa. This modality of purchase has been exploited by organized criminals largely based in Cameroon to conduct advance fee and non-delivery frauds. The article uses data from the volunteer group Petscams.com to provide unique insights on the techniques of the offenders with particular reference to the strategies used to maximize victimization by using real accounts of victims of such frauds. It also briefly notes how the COVID-19 crisis has been used to adapt this type of scam.

	abstract = {Internet fraud scam is a crime enabled by the Internet to swindle Internet users. The global costs of these scams are in the billions of US dollars. Existing research suggests that scammers maximize their economic gain. Although this is a plausible explanation, since the idea of the scam is to fool people to send money, this explanation alone, cannot explain why individuals become Internet scammers. An equally important, albeit unexplored riddle, is the question of what strategies Internet scammers adopt to perform the act. As a first step to address these gaps, we interviewed five Internet scammers in order to develop a rational choice process theory of Internet scammers’ behavior. The initial results suggest that an interplay of socioeconomic and dynamic thinking processes explains why individuals drift into Internet scamming. Once an individual drifts into Internet scamming, a successful scam involves two processes: persuasive strategy and advance fee strategy.},
